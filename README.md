This simple program allows you to unzip a compressed file into a folder of your choice.

After running main.py, you'll need to:
1) Choose a file to unzip
2) Choose a folder where the file will be unzipped
3) Click "Unzip"

And that's it. You can then go and check that the files have been unzipped in the directory you chose.
